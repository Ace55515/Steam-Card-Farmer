# Steam Card Farmer

Designed for advanced users. Install Node.js, run `npm install` to install required packages, then run `node farmer.js`.

It'll prompt you for your Steam username and password. Just because it invariably ends up with someone asking about it, **when you enter your password, no characters will show up**. Don't worry, you're typing.

It'll automatically switch through all games you have with remaining card drops (it checks every 10 minutes). One could theoretically mass-idle all games at once, but it takes just as long and this way doesn't rack up unnecessary fake playtime.

If you have more than 250 games/badges, **this will only idle your [first page](https://steamcommunity.com/my/badges)**. Because I made this application only for myself and shared it just because, I have no plans to add things that I will not use. The best way to get me to support multiple pages is to [buy me games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorMcKay).

# NO SUPPORT

I made this for myself and put it on GitHub just because I can. I WILL PROVIDE NO SUPPORT FOR THIS NOR WILL I IMPLEMENT NEW FEATURES AT YOUR REQUEST.

## WTF is 'SteamStuff'?

It's a module I made to simplify the process of bootstrapping a Node.js Steam bot. You're free to use it however you please and modify it, but I ask that you please don't publish it to npm.
